        content: `Welcome to Intermediate studies! Since you can already read Arabic, we'll focus on deeper understanding.

**The Prophet ﷺ said:** "Allah has ninety-nine names. Whoever memorizes them will enter Paradise." (Bukhari)

But memorizing isn't just reciting - it means understanding and living by them.

In this lesson, you'll learn the most frequently appearing Names in the Quran:
- الله (Allah) - appears 2,699 times
- الرحمن (Ar-Rahman) - appears 57 times
- الرحيم (Ar-Raheem) - appears 114 times
- الرب (Ar-Rabb) - appears 900+ times
- الملك (Al-Malik) - King, Owner

Let's explore each one deeply...`

        title: "الله - Allah (The God)",
        arabicContent: "لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ",
        content: `**الله (Allah)** - The proper name of God

**Linguistic root:** From إله (ilah) - a god
**Meaning:** THE God - the one true deity worthy of worship

**Why it's special:**
- This name encompasses ALL other names
- It can only refer to the One True God
- No plural form exists (unlike "god/gods" in English)

**Pattern in Quran:**
Often paired with other names:
- "اللَّهُ الرَّحْمَٰنُ الرَّحِيمُ" (Allah, the Most Gracious, Most Merciful)
- "اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ" (Allah, there is no god except Him)

**Quran reference:** "He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity" (59:22)

**Reflection:** When you say "Allah," you're calling the One who has every perfect attribute.`

        title: "الرحمن الرحيم - The Most Merciful",
        arabicContent: "الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ",
        content: `**Both derive from رَحِمَ (rahima)** - to show mercy

**الرَّحْمَٰنُ (Ar-Rahman) - The Most Gracious**
- Form: فَعْلَان (fa'lan) - indicates intensity and vastness
- Meaning: Overwhelming, all-encompassing mercy
- Scope: For ALL creation - believers and disbelievers

**الرَّحِيمُ (Ar-Raheem) - The Most Merciful**
- Form: فَعِيل (fa'eel) - indicates continuity
- Meaning: Constant, ongoing mercy
- Scope: Especially for believers in the Hereafter

**Together they teach:**
Allah's mercy is both vast (covering everyone) and specific (especially for believers).

**Hadith:** "Allah divided mercy into 100 parts. He kept 99 parts for the Day of Resurrection, and sent down 1 part to earth. From that 1 part comes all compassion creatures show one another." (Bukhari)

**Exercise:** In the next surah you read, count how many times you see رحم-root words!`

        type: "explanation",
        title: "الرَّبُّ - The Lord, Sustainer, Master",
        arabicContent: "رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ",
        content: `**الرَّبُّ (Ar-Rabb)** - Often translated as "Lord"

But it means SO much more:
1. **Creator** - who brought you into existence
2. **Owner** - who has full right over you
3. **Sustainer** - who provides everything you need
4. **Nurturer** - who raises and develops you
5. **Master** - who guides your affairs
6. **Reformer** - who corrects and improves

**Why prophets loved this name:**
- Ibrahim: "رَبَّنَا تَقَبَّلْ مِنَّا" (Our Lord, accept from us)
- Musa: "رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِي صَدْرِي" (My Lord, expand for me my chest)
- Ayyub: "رَبِّ إِنِّي مَسَّنِيَ الضُّرُّ" (My Lord, adversity has touched me)

**Du'a using Rabb:**
When you call upon "Rabbi" (my Lord), you're acknowledging:
- He created you
- He provides for you
- He can solve your problems
- He has authority over everything in your life

**Practice:** Replace "God" in your thoughts with "my Rabb" - feel the relationship!`

        arabicContent: "مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ",
        content: `**Two related names from the root م-ل-ك (m-l-k):**

**الْمَلِكُ (Al-Malik) - The King**
- Absolute sovereign authority
- Rules without opposition
- His command is always executed

**مَالِكُ (Maalik) - The Owner**
- Owns everything completely
- Has full right to dispose as He wills
- Different from worldly "ownership" - total possession

**In Al-Fatiha:** 
"مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ" (Owner of the Day of Judgment)

**Why Owner, not King, here?**
On that Day, Allah is not just the KING (authority) but the OWNER (sole possessor).
No one can claim ownership of anything - not their deeds, not their bodies, nothing!

**Related words you'll see:**
- مُلْكُ (mulk) - kingdom, dominion
- مَمْلُوكُ (mamlook) - owned/slave
- مَلَكُوت (malakoot) - dominion (heavenly realm)

**Reflection:** Everything you "own" is actually borrowed from Al-Malik.`

        content: `**آمَنَ (aamana)** - to believe, to have faith

**Root:** أ-م-ن (a-m-n) - safety, security, trust

Iman (إيمان) comes from the same root as Amaan (أمان - safety).
To believe is to find SAFETY and SECURITY in Allah.

Particles are tiny words that:

- Change meanings dramatically

**Why they matter:**
The difference between "Allah guides" and "Allah WILL guide" or "MAY Allah guide" comes from a single particle!

**Function:** Emphasizes what follows. When Allah says "إِنَّ", pay extra attention!

**Grammar note:** إِنَّ changes the case of what follows (makes it accusative/منصوب).
That's why we say "إِنَّ اللَّهَ" (Allaha, not Allah).

**Common patterns:**
- إِنَّ اللَّهَ... (Indeed, Allah...)
- إِنَّا (Indeed, We...) - Majestic "We"
- إِنَّهُ (Indeed, He...)
- إِنَّكَ (Indeed, you...)

**Examples in Quran:**
- "إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ" - Indeed, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful
- "إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ" - Indeed, We sent it down on the Night of Power

**لَا (laa)** - No, not
- Used with verbs (present tense): لَا يَعْلَمُونَ (they don't know)
- Used in absolute negation: لَا إِلَٰهَ (there is no god)
- Used for prohibition: لَا تَقْرَبُوا (don't approach)

**مَا (maa)** - Not, did not
- Used with past tense verbs: مَا قَتَلُوهُ (they didn't kill him)
- Used to negate nouns: مَا هَٰذَا بَشَرًا (this is not a human)

**The Shahada uses both:**
"لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ"
- لَا = there is no
- إِلَٰهَ = god
- إِلَّا = except
- اللَّهُ = Allah

**Other uses of مَا:**
- As a question word: مَا هَٰذَا؟ (What is this?)
- As a relative pronoun: مَا أَنزَلْنَا (what We revealed)

- لَا before a verb = "not doing"

- خَلَقَكُم ثُمَّ يَتَوَفَّاكُمْ (He created you, THEN (after a lifetime) causes you to die)
- Deliberate pause between events

**Why it matters:**
- فَ = immediate consequence
- ثُمَّ = consequence after time/reflection

**Example comparison:**
- "قَالَ فَخَرَجَ" - He said, THEN (immediately) left
- "قَالَ ثُمَّ خَرَجَ" - He said, THEN (after some time) left

**In your reading:** Pay attention to which connector is used - it changes the rhythm of events!`

        title: "The Secret to Arabic Vocabulary",
        content: `**The Root System (الجذر)** is Arabic's superpower!

Almost every Arabic word comes from a **3-letter root** that carries a core meaning.

**Example: The root ك-ت-ب (K-T-B) = "writing"**
- كِتَاب (kitaab) - book (thing written)
- كَاتِب (kaatib) - writer (one who writes)
- مَكْتُوب (maktoob) - written (something written)
- مَكْتَبَة (maktaba) - library (place of writing)
- كَتَبَ (kataba) - he wrote (verb)

**One root → Dozens of related words!**

**Why this matters for Quran:**
- The Quran uses approximately 1,700 root words
- Knowing 500 roots = understanding 80%+ of Quranic vocabulary
- Roots reveal hidden connections between concepts

Let's explore the most important Quranic roots!`

        content: `**س-ل-م (S-L-M)** - Core meaning: Peace, Safety, Submission

**Words from this root:**

**سَلَام (salaam)** - peace
"السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ" - Peace be upon you

**إِسْلَام (islaam)** - submission (to Allah)
The religion's name: complete peace through submission to Allah

**مُسْلِم (muslim)** - one who submits
A person who has embraced Islam

**سَلِيم (saleem)** - sound, healthy, pure
"قَلْبٌ سَلِيمٌ" - a sound/pure heart (26:89)

**سَلَّمَ (sallama)** - he greeted, he submitted
"وَسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا" - and submit with complete submission

**The beautiful connection:**
ISLAM = finding PEACE (سلام) through SUBMISSION (إسلام)
A MUSLIM = one with a SOUND (سليم) heart who SUBMITS

**Quran insight:**
When you see any س-ل-م word, remember: true peace comes from submission to Allah.`

        content: `**ح-م-د (H-M-D)** - Core meaning: Praise, Commendation

**Words from this root:**

**حَمْد (hamd)** - praise
"الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ" - All praise is for Allah

**مُحَمَّد (Muhammad)** - The praised one
The Prophet's name ﷺ - "the one who is repeatedly praised"

**أَحْمَد (Ahmad)** - Most praiseworthy
Another name of the Prophet ﷺ mentioned in 61:6

**حَمِيد (Hameed)** - The Praiseworthy
One of Allah's Beautiful Names

**مَحْمُود (Mahmood)** - Praised
"مَقَامًا مَحْمُودًا" - a praised station (17:79)

**The connection:**
- الحَمْدُ (praise) → what we give to Allah
- حَمِيد (Praiseworthy) → Allah's attribute
- مُحَمَّد (praised one) → the Prophet embodying praise

**Pattern recognition:**
- فَعِيل pattern (حَمِيد) often indicates an intensified quality
- مُفَعَّل pattern (مُحَمَّد) indicates something done intensively`

True FAITH (إيمان) brings TRUE SECURITY (أمان)
A BELIEVER (مؤمن) is one who has found SAFETY in Allah
Being TRUSTWORTHY (أمين) reflects having real faith

This root appears in various forms over 800 times!
It's central to the Quranic message.`

It's the science of reciting Quran correctly, giving every letter its rights.

**Why it matters:**
The Prophet ﷺ said: "Beautify the Quran with your voices." (Abu Dawud)

Incorrect recitation can even change meanings!

**In this lesson:**
We'll focus on **Noon Sakinah (نْ)** and **Tanween (ـٌ ـً ـٍ)** rules.

**What is Noon Sakinah?**
- A ن with sukoon (no vowel): نْ
- Example: مِنْ, عَنْ, أَنْ

- The doubled vowel marks that add 'n' sound: ـٌ ـً ـٍ
- Examples: كِتَابٌ (kitaabun), كِتَابًا (kitaaban), كِتَابٍ (kitaabin)

**When:** Noon Sakinah or Tanween is followed by one of 6 throat letters:
**ء ه ع ح غ خ**
(Hamza, Ha, 'Ayn, Haa, Ghayn, Kha)

**How:** Pronounce the noon CLEARLY without any blending.

**Memory trick:** These 6 letters come from the throat (حُرُوفُ الحَلْق)

**Examples:**
- مِنْ خَيْرٍ (min khayrin) - clear ن before خ
- مَنْ آمَنَ (man aamana) - clear ن before ء
- عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ ('aleemun hakeemun) - clear ن (tanween) before ح
- كِتَابًا أَنزَلَهُ (kitaaban anzalahu) - clear ن (tanween) before أ

**Practice:** Say "مِنْ هَادٍ" - make sure you clearly pronounce the noon before the Ha!

**When:** Noon Sakinah or Tanween is followed by:
**ي ر م ل و ن**
(Ya, Ra, Meem, Lam, Waw, Noon)

**Memory trick:** These letters spell **يَرْمَلُونَ** (YARMALOON)

**Two types:**

**A) Idgham with Ghunnah (merging WITH nasal sound):**
When followed by: **ي ن م و** (Ya, Noon, Meem, Waw)
- The noon merges AND there's a humming/nasal sound (ghunnah)
- Hold the ghunnah for 2 counts
- Example: "مَن يَقُولُ" → pronounced "may-yaqool" with ghunnah

**B) Idgham without Ghunnah (merging WITHOUT nasal sound):**
When followed by: **ل ر** (Lam, Ra)
- The noon merges completely, no nasal sound
- Example: "مِن رَّبِّهِمْ" → pronounced "mir-rabbihim"

**Key point:** Idgham only happens when the noon/tanween and the next letter are in DIFFERENT words!

**If same word:** No idgham! Like "دُنْيَا" - say the noon clearly.`

        content: `**Iqlab (إِقْلَاب)** means to convert/flip.

**When:** Noon Sakinah or Tanween is followed by **ب (Ba)** only.

**How:** Convert the noon sound into a **meem** sound with ghunnah!

**Why?** Try saying "minba" quickly - your lips naturally want to close for the Ba, making it easier to say "mimba"!

**Examples:**
- مِنْ بَعْدِ → pronounced "mim ba'di" (with ghunnah)
- أَنْبِئْهُمْ → pronounced "ambi'hum" (with ghunnah)
- سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ → "samee'um baseer" (with ghunnah)

**Recognition tip:** Whenever you see نْ before ب, say "m" with ghunnah instead!

**In the Mushaf:** Sometimes you'll see a small meem (ـ مـ) above the noon to remind you.

**Practice:** "مِنْ بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ" - say "mim bayni yadayhi" with a humming meem.`

**When:** Noon Sakinah or Tanween is followed by any of these 15 letters:
**ت ث ج د ذ ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ف ق ك**

**How:** The noon sound is "hidden" - not fully pronounced, not fully merged. It's between Izhar and Idgham!

**Characteristics:**
1. The noon sound is softened
2. There's a ghunnah (nasal humming)
3. Hold for approximately 2 counts
4. Prepare your tongue for the next letter

**Examples:**
- مَن تَابَ → soft noon with ghunnah before Ta
- مِنْ ذَهَبٍ → soft noon before Dhal
- أَنْزَلَ → soft noon before Za
- عَلِيمٌ قَدِيرٌ → soft noon (tanween) before Qaf

**The most common rule!** Since there are 15 letters, you'll encounter Ikhfa frequently.

**Practice tip:** Think of it as saying the noon "halfway" while your tongue moves toward the next letter's position.`

**What is Meem Sakinah?**
A meem with sukoon (no vowel): مْ
Example: هُمْ, لَهُمْ, عَلَيْهِمْ

**The 3 rules:**
1. **Idgham Shafawi** - Merging (مْ + م)
2. **Ikhfa Shafawi** - Hiding (مْ + ب)
3. **Izhar Shafawi** - Clear (مْ + all other letters)

**"Shafawi" (شَفَوِي)** means "labial" - relating to the lips. 
Because meem is pronounced with the lips!

Let's learn each one...`

        arabicContent: "لَهُم مَّا يَشَاءُونَ",
        content: `**Idgham Shafawi** - Merging of Meem into Meem

**When:** Meem Sakinah (مْ) is followed by another Meem (م)

**How:** Merge them into ONE meem with ghunnah (nasal sound), held for 2 counts.

**Why?** It's natural - when two meems meet, they blend together!

**Examples:**
- لَهُم مَّا → "lahum-maa" (one long meem with ghunnah)
- هُم مُّؤْمِنُونَ → "hum-mu'minoon" (merged meems)
- وَلَكُم مَّا كَسَبْتُم → "walakum-maa kasabtum"

**Visual cue:** In Quran text, you'll often see the second meem with a shaddah (مّ) to indicate the merging.

**Practice:** Say "لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ" - feel how the two meems naturally blend into one sustained meem with humming.`

        arabicContent: "تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ",
        content: `**Ikhfa Shafawi** - Hiding of Meem before Ba

**When:** Meem Sakinah (مْ) is followed by Ba (ب)

**How:** 
1. Close your lips lightly (not completely)
2. Produce a soft ghunnah (nasal humming)
3. Then release into the Ba

**Why?** Meem and Ba are both lip letters. They're "cousins" - so the meem hides!

**Examples:**
- تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ → soft meem with ghunnah before Ba
- أَنفُسَهُمْ بِذَٰلِكَ → "anfusahum-bi" with ghunnah
- هُمْ بِرَبِّهِمْ → "hum-bi" with soft meem and ghunnah

**Compare to Iqlab:** 
Remember how Noon before Ba becomes Meem? This is similar but simpler - the meem just gets "hidden" with ghunnah.

**Practice:** Say "عَلَيْهِمْ بِلِسَانِهِمْ" - feel the soft meem blending into the Ba.`

        arabicContent: "عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ",
        content: `**Izhar Shafawi** - Clear pronunciation of Meem

**When:** Meem Sakinah (مْ) is followed by ANY letter EXCEPT Meem or Ba.

**How:** Pronounce the meem clearly with NO ghunnah, then move to the next letter.

**Examples:**
- عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ → clear "him" then "ghayri"
- أَنعَمْتَ → clear meem, then Ta
- أَلَمْ تَرَ → clear meem, then Ta
- وَهُمْ فِيهَا → clear meem, then Fa
- لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٌ → clear meem, then Jeem

**The default rule:** 
Since Meem + Meem and Meem + Ba are special cases, everything else is Izhar (clear pronunciation).

**26 letters** trigger Izhar Shafawi (all except م and ب).

**Practice:** In Al-Fatiha: "عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ"
Find the meem sakinah and pronounce it clearly before غ and و.`

| | نْ + throat = Izhar |

**Key differences:**
1. Meem only interacts specially with م and ب (both lip letters)
2. Noon interacts with many more letters
3. Meem Ikhfa only has ONE letter (ب), Noon Ikhfa has 15!

**Same concept:** Letters that share articulation points affect each other more.

- Meem + Meem = brothers merge
- Meem + Ba = cousins hide
- Meem + anyone else = strangers stay clear`

In Tajweed, it refers to stretching the sound of certain letters.

**The 3 Madd Letters:**
1. **ا (Alif)** - when preceded by Fatha: بَا (baa)
2. **و (Waw)** - when preceded by Damma: بُو (boo)
3. **ي (Ya)** - when preceded by Kasra: بِي (bee)

**Madd Counts:**
We measure elongation in "counts" (حَرَكَات):
- 2 counts = natural length (طَبِيعِي)
- 4 counts = medium length
- 6 counts = maximum length

**Why it matters:**
Elongation adds beauty and meaning. A well-placed madd can:
- Create emphasis
- Build anticipation
- Mark endings
- Distinguish similar words`

**Duration:** 2 counts (2 حَرَكَات)

**When:** Any madd letter (ا, و, ي) not followed by hamza or sukoon.

**Examples:**
- قَالَ (qaala) - stretch the "aa" for 2 counts
- يَقُولُ (yaqoolu) - stretch the "oo" for 2 counts
- فِيهَا (feehaa) - stretch both "ee" and final "aa"

**How to count:**
One count ≈ the time to open or close your fingers once.
Two counts = open, close. That's natural madd!

**In Al-Fatiha:**
- نَسْتَعِينُ (nasta'eenu) - "ee" is 2 counts
- الصِّرَاطَ (as-siraata) - "aa" is 2 counts
- الضَّالِّينَ (ad-daalleen) - "aa" and "ee" are each 2 counts

**Examples:**
- جَآءَ (jaa'a) - the alif before hamza is stretched 4-5 counts
- سُوءٌ (soo'un) - the waw before hamza is stretched
- سِيئَتْ (see'at) - the ya before hamza is stretched

**Why it's called "connected" (muttasil):**
The madd letter and hamza are CONNECTED in one word - they can't be separated.

**In Quran:**
- "إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ" (When the victory of Allah comes)
- Stretch جَآءَ for 4-5 counts

**Examples:**
- يَا أَيُّهَا (yaa ayyuhaa) - the alif of "ya" before the hamza of "ayyuhaa"
- فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ (fee anfusikum) - the ya before the hamza
- قُوا أَنفُسَكُمْ (qoo anfusakum) - the waw before the hamza

**Why it's called "separated" (munfasil):**
The madd letter and hamza are SEPARATED in different words - you could stop between them.

**Flexibility:** 
Different reciters use different lengths. Hafs 'an Asim typically uses 4-5 counts.

- الضَّالِّينَ (ad-DAAAL-leen) - the "aa" before the doubled Lam
- Stretch for 6 full counts!

**2. Harfi (in letters at beginning of surahs):**
- الم (Alif-Lam-Meem) - each letter name contains madd lazim
- Stretch each for 6 counts

**Why so long?**
The sukoon or shaddah after the madd creates a "heaviness" that requires maximum stretch.

**In Al-Fatiha:**
The ONLY madd lazim is: وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ
The alif before the shaddah on Lam gets 6 counts!

        content: `**Qalqalah (قَلْقَلَة)** means "to shake" or "to disturb."

In tajweed, it refers to the slight bouncing or echoing sound made when certain letters have sukoon.

**The 5 Qalqalah Letters:**
**ق ط ب ج د**

**Memory phrase:** "قُطْبُ جَدّ" (Qutbu Jadd - "The grandfather's pole")

**Why do these letters echo?**
These letters are:
1. Strong consonants (not soft/flowing)
2. When they have sukoon (no vowel), they can't flow smoothly
3. So they "bounce" or "echo" slightly when released

**Two levels of Qalqalah:**
1. **Small (صُغْرَى)** - in the middle of a word
2. **Large (كُبْرَى)** - at the END of a word (when stopping)`

        content: `**Small Qalqalah** - When the letter is in the MIDDLE of a word.

**Characteristics:**
- Subtle bounce
- Lighter echo
- Continues smoothly to next sound

**Examples:**

**ق in middle:** "يَقْتُلُونَ" (yaqtuloon) - slight bounce on Qaf
**ط in middle:** "يَطْمَعُونَ" (yatma'oon) - slight bounce on Ta
**ب in middle:** "يَبْتَغُونَ" (yabtaghoon) - slight bounce on Ba
**ج in middle:** "يَجْعَلُونَ" (yaj'aloon) - slight bounce on Jeem
**د in middle:** "يَدْخُلُونَ" (yadkhuloon) - slight bounce on Dal

**Practice:**
Read "أَقْرَبُ" (aqrabu) - Feel the slight bounce on the Qaf, but don't exaggerate!

**Common mistake:** Making the echo too strong. Small qalqalah is SUBTLE.`

**Characteristics:**
- More pronounced bounce
- Clear echo
- The air pressure builds and releases

**Examples from Surah Al-Ikhlas:**

- "أَحَدٌ" → When stopping: "أَحَدْ" - strong bounce on Dal
- "الصَّمَدُ" → When stopping: "الصَّمَدْ" - strong bounce on Dal
- "يُولَدْ" - strong bounce on Dal
- "يَلِدْ" - strong bounce on Dal

**From Surah Al-Falaq:**
- "الْفَلَقْ" (al-falaq) - strong bounce on Qaf

**From Surah Al-Masad:**
- "تَبَّ" (tabb) - strong bounce on Ba
- "لَهَبْ" (lahab) - strong bounce on Ba

**Practice technique:**
1. Say the word normally
2. Stop on the final letter
3. Let the air release with a slight "pop"
4. It should sound like a very short echo: "ahad-d"`

4. During Iqlab

**Duration:**
Ghunnah is held for **2 counts** (like natural madd)

1. Close your mouth (for meem) or let air flow through nose (for noon)
2. Let the sound resonate in your nasal cavity
3. You should feel vibration in your nose!`

- أَنَّ (anna) - "that" - ghunnah required

- أُمَّة (ummah) - "nation" - hum the doubled meem
- ثُمَّ (thumma) - "then" - nasal humming on مّ
- لَمَّا (lammaa) - "when" - ghunnah required

**Practice technique:**
1. Say إِنَّ
2. On the نّ, pinch your nose
3. If the sound stops, you're doing it right! (sound comes from nose)
4. Release and let it hum for 2 counts

**In Al-Fatiha:**
- "الضَّالِّينَ" - the shaddah is on Lam (ل), not noon, so no ghunnah there
- But when you read "إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ" in Al-Kawthar, the إِنَّ has ghunnah!`

- "مِن وَلِيّ" → "miw-waliyy" - 2 count ghunnah

**2. Ikhfa (of Noon):**
When Noon Sakinah meets the 15 Ikhfa letters
- "مِن قَبْلِ" → soft noon with 2 count ghunnah
- "أَنتُمْ" → ghunnah on the hidden noon

**3. Iqlab:**
When Noon becomes Meem before Ba
- "مِنْ بَعْدِ" → "mim ba'd" - the meem has ghunnah

**4. Ikhfa Shafawi (of Meem):**
When Meem Sakinah meets Ba
- "هُمْ بِهِ" → soft meem with ghunnah

**Key insight:**
Almost every time you encounter noon or meem interacting with another letter, there's likely ghunnah involved!`

وَقَالُوا لَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ مَا كُنَّا فِي أَصْحَابِ السَّعِيرِ

**"And they will say, 'If only we had listened or reasoned, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze.'"**

**The tragic admission:**
- They ADMIT a warner came (بَلَىٰ)
- They ADMIT they denied (فَكَذَّبْنَا)
- They ADMIT they didn't listen or reason (لَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ)

**The solution was simple:** Listen (نَسْمَعُ) + Think (نَعْقِلُ)
They chose to reject both.`
