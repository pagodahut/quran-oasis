# Hifz Methodology Research
## Traditional Training Methods

### 1. The Three-Part Daily System (Sabaq-Sabqi-Manzil)
Traditional Tahfiz schools structure daily practice into three components:

**Sabaq (سبق) — New Lesson**
- Fresh verses to memorize today
- Typically 1-2 pages for beginners, up to 1 juz for advanced
- Uses intensive repetition (20-50 times)

**Sabqi (سبقی) — Recent Review**
- Verses memorized in the last 7-30 days
- Still being solidified in memory
- Review 1-2 pages daily from this pool

**Manzil (منزل) — Old Revision**
- Everything memorized more than 30 days ago
- Long-term retention through periodic review
- Review 1-3 juz daily to maintain

### 2. Talaqqi Method (تلقي)
Direct teacher-student transmission:
- Student recites to teacher (Tasmik/تسميع)
- Teacher corrects pronunciation and tajweed
- Oral tradition preserving exact pronunciation
- Cannot be replaced by apps, but can be supplemented

### 3. Memorization Techniques

**10-3 Method**
1. Read the verse 10 times while looking
2. Recite 3 times from memory
3. If failed, restart from step 1

**20-20 Method (for challenging verses)**
1. Read verse 20 times while looking
2. Recite 20 times from memory
3. More intensive for difficult passages

**Stacking (Takrar)**
1. Memorize verse 1
2. Memorize verse 2, then recite 1+2
3. Memorize verse 3, then recite 1+2+3
4. Continue building the chain
5. Maximum chain: typically 7-10 verses before consolidation

**Page Method**
1. Divide page into portions (3-4 portions)
2. Memorize each portion using 10-3
3. Stack portions together
4. Connect to previous pages

### 4. Daily Schedule (Traditional Tahfiz)

| Time | Activity | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|
| Fajr | New memorization (Sabaq) | 1-2 hours |
| Morning | Sabqi review | 30-60 min |
| Dhuhr | Manzil revision | 1-2 hours |
| Asr | Review with teacher (Tasmik) | 30-60 min |
| Maghrib | Light review | 30 min |
| Isha | Preparation for tomorrow | 30 min |

### 5. Review Cycles (Traditional)

| Interval | What to Review |
|----------|----------------|
| Daily | Previous day's lesson |
| Weekly | Last 7 days |
| Monthly | Last 30 days |
| Quarterly | Previous quarters |
| Bi-annually | Complete revision |

## Modern Science of Memorization

### Spaced Repetition
- Review at increasing intervals: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 30, 60 days
- Based on Ebbinghaus forgetting curve
- SM-2 algorithm (SuperMemo) adapted for Quran

### Active Recall
- Testing yourself > passive re-reading
- Hide text and try to recite
- Identify weak spots through self-testing

### Interleaving
- Mix old and new material
- Don't just focus on new verses
- Random review strengthens connections

### Sleep & Memory
- Memory consolidation happens during sleep
- Review before bed = stronger retention
- Morning memorization after good sleep is most effective

## Tajweed Rules (Key Ones for App)

### Pronunciation Rules to Detect

1. **Makharij (مخارج)** — Articulation points
   - Each letter has specific origin point
   - Common errors: ح vs ه, ع vs أ, ض vs د

2. **Sifat (صفات)** — Letter characteristics
   - Heavy vs light letters
   - Common errors: not distinguishing ط from ت

3. **Noon Sakinah & Tanween**
   - Idgham (merging)
   - Ikhfa (hiding)
   - Iqlab (converting)
   - Izhar (clear pronunciation)

4. **Meem Sakinah**
   - Idgham Shafawi
   - Ikhfa Shafawi
   - Izhar Shafawi

5. **Madd (Elongation)**
   - Natural madd (2 counts)
   - Connected madd (4-5 counts)
   - Necessary madd (6 counts)

### Common Beginner Mistakes
1. Not elongating madd letters properly
2. Pronouncing thick letters as thin
3. Missing ghunnah (nasalization)
4. Incorrect stops and starts
5. Running words together

## AI Features for Quran Apps

### Speech Recognition
- Web Speech API (basic)
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (better Arabic)
- Custom models trained on Quranic recitation

### What AI Can Detect
1. **Word accuracy** — Did they say the right words?
2. **Madd length** — Are elongations correct?
3. **Pauses** — Stopping at correct places?
4. **Speed** — Too fast or appropriate pace?

### What AI Struggles With (Currently)
1. Subtle tajweed nuances
2. Exact pronunciation of similar letters
3. Quality of voice (beautiful vs just correct)
4. Emotional/spiritual quality of recitation

### Tarteel's Approach
- Focus on word-by-word tracking
- Gentle corrections without overwhelming
- "Follow along" mode for learning
- "Memorization" mode for testing
- Mistake highlighting without stopping flow

## Islamic Design Principles

### Visual Elements
1. **Geometric patterns** — Infinite, symbolizing divine perfection
2. **Arabesques** — Flowing vegetal patterns
3. **Calligraphy** — The Quran as visual art
4. **Illumination** — Gold leaf, intricate borders

### Color Symbolism
- **Gold** — Divine light, revelation
- **Green** — Islam, paradise, nature
- **Blue** — Sky, infinity, calm
- **White** — Purity
- **Black** — Elegance, depth (often for text)

### Typography
- **Uthmani script** — Traditional mushaf style
- **Amiri** — Modern, readable
- **Scheherazade** — Elegant, flowing
- **KFGQPC fonts** — King Fahd Complex official

### UX Principles
1. **Respect** — The Quran is sacred; no casual treatment
2. **Focus** — Minimize distractions
3. **Accessibility** — All Muslims should be able to use it
4. **Patience** — Memorization is a long journey
5. **Encouragement** — Positive reinforcement
