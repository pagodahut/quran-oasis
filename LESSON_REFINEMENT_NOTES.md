## Potential Refinements

### 1. More Interactive Practice (High Impact)
**Problem:** Ratio of explanation:practice is ~4:1. Users learn but don't drill enough.

**Suggestions:**
- Add flashcard-style vocabulary drills after each lesson
- More "fill in the blank" Quranic exercises
- Tajweed rule identification quizzes with audio playback
- Timed recognition drills for root words

### 2. Audio Integration (Medium Impact)
**Problem:** Only 9 audio steps across all lessons.

**Suggestions:**
- Embed Quran.com audio for every ayah reference
- Add "listen and repeat" exercises
- Tajweed lessons should have audio examples for each rule
- Include different reciters for variety

### 3. Memorization Techniques (High Impact)
**Problem:** Lessons teach concepts but don't guide actual memorization.

**Suggestions:**
- Add step-by-step memorization flows (based on HIFZ_RESEARCH.md methods)
- Include "chunk and stack" exercises
- Spaced repetition prompts built into lessons
- Progress tracking for each surah portion

### 4. Visual Diagrams
**Problem:** Tajweed rules are text-heavy.

**Suggestions:**
- Throat/mouth position diagrams for makharij
- Color-coded tajweed highlighting
- Flowcharts for rule application (e.g., "Is it noon sakinah? → Check next letter...")

### 5. Mutashabihat Deep Dives
**Problem:** Two lessons on similar verses may not be enough for advanced students.

**Suggestions:**
- Expand with more juz-specific mutashabihat
- Add comparison tables
- Include memory hooks/mnemonics for confusing pairs

### 6. Lesson Pacing
**Problem:** Some lessons are very long (30+ min estimated).

**Suggestions:**
- Consider splitting longer lessons into parts
- Add checkpoints/milestones within lessons
- Allow "save progress" within a lesson

## Quick Wins (Can Do Now)

1. Add 2-3 more quiz steps per lesson
2. Ensure every surah reference has playable audio
3. Add vocabulary review at end of each unit
4. Include "next steps" recommendations

## Questions for Naimul

- What's the target user: casual learner or serious hafiz-track student?
- Should we add more surahs to the memorization curriculum?
- Any specific tajweed rules that need more depth?
- Should lessons have difficulty settings (quick vs deep)?
